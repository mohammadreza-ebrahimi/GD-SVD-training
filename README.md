# GD-SVD-training
This is the repository in order to train two important concept in machine learning, Gradient Descend (GD) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

In Jupyter notebook I provided contains a comprehensive introduction about ***Linear*** models. There are several mothods
in order to train our model ***Linearly***. These methods are  

- **Normal Equation**
- **LinearRegression from Scikit-learn**

The latter uses a function individually in `numpy.linalg` which is `lstsq`. **Least Square** utilizes very interesting function called **Psuedoinvariance** .

For more precise information first study the ***Jupyter notebook***. Along with it, see `.py` file which includes an example on this topic.

Please [contact](mailto:m.reza.ebrahimi1995@gmail.com) me if you have any question or suggestion.
