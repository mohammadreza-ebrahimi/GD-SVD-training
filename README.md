# GD-SVD-training
This is the repository in order to train two important concept in machine learning, Gradient Descend (GD) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

In Jupyter notebook I provided an comprehensive introduction about ***Linear*** models. There are several mothods
in order to train our model ***Linearly***. These methods are  

- **Normal Equation**
- **LinearRegression from Scikit-learn**

The latter individualy uses a function in `numpy.linalg` which is `lstsq`. **Least Square** utilizes very interesting function called **Psuedoinvariance** .
